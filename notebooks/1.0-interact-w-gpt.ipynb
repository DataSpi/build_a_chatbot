In 1950, Alan Turing published his famous paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which he proposed the Turing test as a way to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of researchers began to explore the possibility of using computers to understand and generate natural language. One of the earliest and most influential of these was Roger Schank, who developed a series of programs that could understand simple stories.\n",

      "Other important figures in the early history of NLP include Gerald Salton, who developed the vector space model for representing documents, and Christopher Manning, who developed the part-of-speech tagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1980s and 1990s saw a dramatic increase in the amount of research in NLP, with the establishment of a number of important journals and conferences, such as the annual Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING).\n",
